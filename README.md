# Helicopter Task Prototype

A Prototype with the main mechanics of the Helicopter task. Move the bucket using the keys\mouse click and press space to drop a coin.

# Running the game

In order to run the game, you need to use [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

Then run:
```
npm install
``` 
npm will install dependencies. When that is done:
```
npm run dev
```

Then if everything is working a link will appear in the terminal, usually  http://localhost:8080/.
